        <h1 class="text-title"> Vanier College’s History & Campus </h1>
        Since it’s inauguration on September  8th,  1970, Vanier has served the local aspiring professionals and academics for over 49 years. <br/>
        Vanier college adopted  its  name  from  Georges  P.  Vanier  (23  April  1888  –  5 March  1967),  who was a soldier  and  one  of  the  two  Governor  Generals  of  Canada  with  Canadian  roots:  He  was  born  in Montreal, QC. In the 99’ issue of Maclean’s, he was voted first place on the list of “100  Most  Influential Canadians of All Time”.<br/>
        In addition, the Vanier campus consists of several buildings that used to belong to the Soeurs  de Sainte-Croix, who  operated  the  convent Notre-Dame-des-Anges.  They  also  merged  the  former  privately owned all-women’s college, Basile Moreau. All these establishments have since been renovated, yet they still retain their historical charm that makes Vanier so unique. Moreover, new buildings have since been added, such the Sports Complex. <br/>
        Vanier  is  also  one  of  the  only  Montreal  college’s  to  have  a  community  garden  on  campus.  The harvest  is  distributed  to  students  and Jake’s  Cafe at  the  end  of  the  season.  Furthermore,  Vanier  has  a newly   built   Learning   Commons   space,   which   consists   of   the   library,   the   Science   Technology Engineering  and  Mathematics  (STEM  Centre)  and  the  Tutoring  &  Academic  Success  Centre  (TASC). The  library  features  titles  from  all  academic  disciplines.  It  also  offers  a  quiet  place  to  study,  vinyl listenings, printing services and laptop rentals.  The STEM Centre is a study space for math and science students. It is also home of the robotics room, where all the magic happens behind the scenes. Lastly, the  TASC  centre  offers  both  a  study  space,  peer  tutoring  and  staff who  are  here  to  help  any  student with their assignments.<br/>
